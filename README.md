Clustering is a technique which used to classify the dataset into group of datas

There are many clustering techniques implemented. 

Here in this project I am using agglomerative clustering, to obtain the accurate group of clusters. 

The dataset used here is nutrition.csv.

Upon applying agglomerative clustering, we can classify which food are high in nutrition and which food having low nutrition.
